# Littlefoot.js Code Review

Overview
Littlefoot is a JS/TS plugin that makes footnotes more interactive by using popovers. It was developed after forking from bigfoot but does not need JQuery to run. It currently works on the latest version of JS(ES14)  and can be built using the npm version after 4.1.2. 

## Code Design and Pattern:

One design pattern that littlefoot uses is modularization, and by that we mean littlefoot has different files corresponding to specific functionalities. For instance, the document.ts file handles footnote and comment manipulation, which focus on DOM interactions, querying, element creation, etc. The events.ts contains events for handling mechanisms such as a click or a hover. The footnote.ts is responsible for footnote-specific interactions such as showing the footnote or dismissing the footnote. The layout.ts, as suggested by its name, focuses on layout management for the popovers. Lastly scoll.ts deals with scrolling through the contents inside a popover. After all, these functionalities are exported to the main littlefoot.js where they are utilized. This architecture makes the design clean and simple, and more importantly introduces scalability. As more features can be added easily and debugging a specific function would be simple under such structure. Yet, there is one crucial thing that is lacking in all of the code, which is documentation. We can never explain enough about how important it is to have a well-written documentation, but clearly the developers of littlefoot did not consider that. As a result, our group had a hard time going through the code and we often had to stop and search online about a specific line of code to see what it does. Imagine if we were new members on board, this would create a new problem. Thus a change we made is to add some general documentation to the code. 
Another thing that we want to mention is the usage of typescript over javascript. It is definitely reasonable that the developers want to use typescript to minimize the risk of unexpected behavior by the users, since the usage of littlefoot relies on the user typing whatever input they want. Yet, it could be a bit of overhead as the functionalities provided by littlefoot are not very complicated. Also this could cause potential conflict since the user might have other code written in javascript.
