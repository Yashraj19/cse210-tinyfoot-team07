# CSE210 Team07 Retrospective

## What went well
- **Sohan Muthanegere Chidanand**: Members took ownership of their components and delivered as promised.
- **Haitian Xu**: Successfully implemented a responsive Tinyfoot stylesheet; communication with front-end team was smooth and tasks were completed on time.
- **Zhihang Li**: Proper connection and goal-setting within sub-team; smooth code review and unit testing.
- **Ohm Rishabh Venkatachalam**: Tasks were well-divided and everyone took responsibility.
- **Bhaswati Das Gupta**: Regular meetings and clear communication ensured awareness of progress/blockers.
- **Ishan Pendse**: Strong team bonding and fair division of work.
- **Justin He**: Effective task splitting and daily collaboration within sub-teams.
- **Yashraj Gavhane**: Team was active and took ownership of tasks, ensuring quality work.
- **Sang Yoon Byun**: We were able to communicate regularly and clearly in the limited time we had. Having at least one member in each sub-group with more technical background helped a lot.

## What didnâ€™t go well
- **Sohan Muthanegere Chidanand**: More sync-up meetings to discuss design ideas and approaches could have been beneficial.
- **Haitian Xu**: Some style issues appeared during testing on different platforms, which took extra time to fix.
- **Zhihang Li**: Encountered several issues when writing unit tests, with many test cases failing initially.
- **Ohm Rishabh Venkatachalam**: Lack of experience in web development led to difficulty understanding the codebase.
- **Bhaswati Das Gupta**: New tools posed challenges for some members, though contributions were still made.
- **Ishan Pendse**: Lack of initial rules for repository maintenance and late adoption of PRs for new features.
- **Justin He**: Difficulty understanding TypeScript code and limited collaboration towards the end due to other work.
- **Yashraj Gavhane**: Documentation could have been improved.
- **Sang Yoon Byun**: While splitting up the work had advantages, it sometimes felt like the project was a little siloed in that sub-groups had very specific tasks to complete and not much interaction with other sub-groups.

## What should be done better
- **Sohan Muthanegere Chidanand**: Upskilling and more discussions on design ideas.
- **Haitian Xu**: Early testing across different browsers to avoid late debugging.
- **Zhihang Li**: Improve knowledge of HTML, Jest, and design patterns.
- **Ohm Rishabh Venkatachalam**: Improve web development basics.
- **Bhaswati Das Gupta**: Improve visibility of what each member is working on.
- **Ishan Pendse**: Better use of GitHub from the start (PRs, branches, reviews).
- **Justin He**: Improve communication and soft skills, and better time management.
- **Yashraj Gavhane**: Implement better version control and put more focus on architectural decisions.
- **Sang Yoon Byun**: Should have more regular meetings where every member can actively share their ideas and express opinions. Set up protocols or systematic ways of working as a group (how we use Github, etc).
